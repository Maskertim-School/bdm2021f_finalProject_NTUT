# K-Means Clustering based on MapReduce
K-Means is a clustring algorithm designed to partition unlabelled data into a certain number (that’s the “K”) of distinct groupings. K-Means clustering based on MapReduce speeds up the execution either on standalone or distributed computing.
MapReduce has several advantages for speeding up K-means clustring algorithm:
* Parallel: it makes the best of multicore computer.
* Simpilicity: only consider **Map** and **Reduce** concepts.
* Distribution: Makes this algorithm possible to run on distributed mode.
